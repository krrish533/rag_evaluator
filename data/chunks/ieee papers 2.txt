Abstract 
Extant research over the last d ecades has stressed how artifici al intelligence (AI) can be used to boost the 
recruitment process and to attr act the best talents. Although A I is increasingly used for talent acquisition, with 36% 
of hiring processes expected to have a pre-screen through AI (O racle, 2019) in the next two years, we have 
limited knowledge of how AI shapes talents’ perceptions about t he organisation to which they are applying to. 
T h e  g o a l  o f  t h i s  r e s e a r c h  i s  t o  i n v e s t i g a t e  i f  a n d  h o w  t h e  u s a g e of AI in the recruitment process improves 
employer attractiveness and employer branding in the eyes of th e applicants. To investig ate this issue a survey 
has been conducted on a random sample of individuals composed o f 50% females and 50% males. To examine 
the survey’s result a structural  equation modeling (SEM) has be en applied. Results showed a positive 
relationship between EB and AI and more in particular that AI-e nabled tools are perceived in a positive way by 
potential candidates. Thus, according to this study, AI is sign ificantly related to Employ er branding and therefore 
it contributes to improving talent attraction.

1. Introduction 
Organizations operating in the contemporary competitive environ ment derive much of their wealth from 
intellectual capital (IC) (Kaplan and Norton, 2004). In this co ntext, the real competitive advantage lies in the 
quality of the people the compan y employs (Beechler and Woodwar d, 2009). As a result, the ability to attract and 
retain the best talents have become one of the key goals for or ganizations (Chambers et al., 1998). The role and 
relevance of onboarding the best employees and keeping them ali gned is also emphasized by current theories of 
customer centricity which stre ss how employees are key to succe ssfully engaging with customers and therefore 
to implement the customer centricity paradigm within the organi zation (Colleoni et al., 2021). In order to attract 
the best employees, companies increasingly implement sophistica ted targeted communication and marketing 
actions, engaging in a process of Employer Branding (EB) with t he goal of building an attractive image for its 
current and future employees. 
The employer branding process is anchored on the belief that an  effective branding of an organisation as an 
attractive employer, can give a co mpany an advantage in the “wa r for talent” by attracting and retaining a 
talented workforce (Sutherland et al. 2002). Against the backdr op of the ascending role of human capital, the 
technological context of how companies recruit people has also changed. Currently, companies are experiencing 
a great transformation in their recruitment practices thanks to  the introduction of artific ial intelligence (AI) tools 
in recruiting related activities. Based on Oracle’s (2019) rese arch, over a third (36%) of HR professionals say 
they expect high utilization of AI in the next two years and 61 % of the respondents expect at least moderate 
utilization within a year (Oracle,  2019). Therefore, in the fut ure HR professionals will need to become more 
knowledgeable in this area as mor e recruitment-related products  and services will incorporate AI into them. It is 
therefore crucial to understand how to use AI at best to ensure  the best selection of talents. 
The majority of the research a lready conducted on recruiting an d selection through AI techniques focused largely 
on the reliability and validity of recruitment and selection pr ocess, activities and techniques (Van Esch et al., 
2021). Surprisingly, little research has been conducted on how AI shapes job candidates’ perceptions of the 
organisation using AI in the selection process. Given the impor tance of candidate reactions to recruiting 
techniques, the little number of empirical studies focusing on the topic (Van Esch, Bl ack, Franklin , & Harder, 
ijbm.ccsenet.org International Jo urnal of Business and Manageme nt V ol. 17, No. 2; 2022 
46 
 2020), and the spread of the use of AI-enabled tools in recruit ing, it seems that a study of candidate perception 
and reaction on AI-enabled recruiting could make worthwhile con tributions to both research and practice (Van 
Esch, P., Black, J. S., & Ferolie, J., 2019). Therefore, aiming  to start filling the gap, this study assesses how the 
perception of AI systems held by potential employees influences  the perceived employee brand attractiveness 
and, as a consequence, the candidates’ intention to submit a jo b application to the organisation. 
The paper is structured as follows. In the first part of the pa per, we review the literature on employer branding, 
employer attractiveness, and AI-e nabled recruitment. In particu lar, in the first paragraph, we review the 
state-of-the-art of employer branding debate, and outline the c urrent employer branding framework. In the 
second paragraph, we introduce th e state-of-the art debate on A rtificial intelligence usage for recruitment, outline 
open points, and formulate the hypothesis at the heart of the s tudy. Based on the hypothesis formulated, we 
present an updated framework for employer branding that also in cludes AI-enabled recruitment. In the second 
part, we present the data collected, the variables used in the analysis and the analytical procedure applied in 
order to test the relevance and impact of AI-enabled recruitmen t in the employer branding process. In the third 
section, we present the results of our statistical model and co nclude drawing implications of our findings for the 
employer branding studies. 
2. Theoretical Framework 2.1 Competing for Attracting Talents High-quality employees are critical to the firm's competitivene ss in the global economy. As extensive research 
has shown, the ability of companies to attract and retain talen ts is crucial for a firm success (Chambers et al., 
1998) because of the transition from the industrial age (produc t-based) to the information age (knowledge-based), 
in which companies derive much of their value from the manageme nt and manipulation of knowledge, rather 
than raw material (Johnson et al., 2005). However, while in the  past it has been relatively easy to find resources 
for companies, radical changes in the labor market structure in  recent years have caused companies to be 
involved in what McKinsey called a "war" for the acquisition of  talent to survive growing global competition 
(Michaels et al., 2001). As a consequence, businesses face toug h times and need strategies to maintain their 
position as companies highly valued by potential and existing e mployees (Lievens & Highhouse, 2003). To 
attract and retain talents, traditional working benefits, such as high salaries and prestigious positions are relevant 
but not always defining (Gray & Balmer, 1998). Instead, current  research has shown how talents increasingly 
search for incentives different from financial (Lievens & Highh ouse, 2003). Increasingly workers look for 
companies that they perceive can  maximize their career potentia l, increase their skills, provide a satisfying 
working environment and leave up  to their ethical standards (Ch owdhury, 2003). Being able to create this 
perception means creating an environment that first and foremos t conveys a coherent identity, that emanates trust 
and above all an environment that  makes its employees proud. An  employee who is proud of his or her work and 
the performance that his or her company can achieve, who feels that he or she is part of a group within which he 
can be and express himself, certa inly has every intention of re maining in the company for as long as possible and 
continue to contribute to its success. On the other hand, a com pany that is capable of doing this and that makes 
its employees so proud, also has  a high chance of attracting ne w talent. Thus, the challenge of HR managers 
today is to put in place long-term company strategies that make  their company being perceived as an attractive 
place to work. 
2.2 Employer Branding for Attracting Talents 
The most popular framework used by companies in order to establ ish long term strategies to attract, select and 
retain the most competent workers is known as Employer Branding  (EB). Despite the recent application of this 
phenomenon, its birth can be traced back when Tim Ambler and Si mon Barrow first coined it as a way of 
combining branding techniques with human resource practices (Am bler & Barrow, 1996). Kotler (2001) defines 
a brand as “a name, term, sign, symbol, or design, or a combina tion of them which is intended to identify the 
goods and services of one seller or group of sellers and to dif ferentiate them from those of competitors” (p.719). 
The definition has primarily been used to describe product bran ds and the consumer’s relationship toward the 
brand (Mosley, 2007). However, according to the current marketi ng literature, a brand has a positive impact on 
the company as an employer as it allows external stakeholders t
o identify the organization, the corporate brand 
and the firm as a future w orkplace (Gaddam, 2008).  
Before the concept of employer branding was created, Kotler (19 94) contributed to the current understanding of 
the concept of employer branding using the term internal market ing to describe the task of successfully hiring, 
training and motivating employees  to serve the customer well. B y satisfying employee’s needs, their motivation 
increases as well as their involvement and commitment towards t he company. For instance, companies started 
ijbm.ccsenet.org International Jo urnal of Business and Manageme nt V ol. 17, No. 2; 2022 
47 
 realising that employees should be considered a tool to differe ntiate an employer among the competition in order 
to attract highly skilled labor (Kotler, 1994). Thus, branding and EB are closely related, as what characterizes a 
strong brand is mostly consistent with successful employer bran ds (Öster & Jonze, 2013). Accordingly, Branham 
(2000) defines employer branding as the practice of “applying t raditional marketing principles to achieving the 
status of Employer of Choice […], the process of placing an ima ge of being a great place to work in the mind of 
the targeted candidate pool” (Branham, 2000, p.18). Soon, Backh aus and Tikoo (2004) build on this definition 
and define employer branding as the process of building an iden tifiable and unique employer identity, and the 
employer brand as a concept of the firm that differentiates it from its competitors. According to Sullivan (2004), 
employer branding is a strategy to manage stakeholders’ awarene ss, perceptions, opinions, and beliefs with 
regards to a particular organization. Employer branding represe nts organizations’ efforts to communicate to 
internal and external audiences w hat makes it both desirable an d different as an employer. (Jenner & Taylor, 
2007). It is concerned with building an image in the minds of t he potential employees that the company is a 
‘great place to work’ (Ewing et  al., 2002). For this purpose, c ompanies have begun to develop targeted 
recruitment marketing actions so to create a corporate image co nsistent with the identity of the company, aimed 
at attracting and retaining talented resources. In other words,  employer branding as a concept summarises the 
strategies of recruiting marketing aiming at developing an imag e of the company which is coherent with the 
company’s identity as an ideal working environment (employer of  choice). In this way , the company is able to 
attract and build a loyal relationship with talented employees.  
2.2.1 Factors Influencing the Employer Attractiveness and the E mployer Branding Process 
Employer branding is the result of a process in which a firm cr eates and communicates a convincing “employer 
value proposition” (Backhaus & Tikoo, 2004). The “employer valu e proposition” (EVP) is defined as the full 
“package of reward features or em ployment advantages and benefi ts offered to employees” (Barrow & Mosley, 
2005; Edwards, 2010), which in order to be valuable for the tal ents must be linked to the central message that is 
conveyed by the corporate brand (Backhaus & Tikoo, 2004). The c oncept of employer branding lies at the 
intersection between EVP and business objectives, understood as  a set of activities aimed at spreading an 
employer identity that allows to narrow the gap between the des ired image (by management) and perceived 
image (by current or potential employees)” (Lievens et al., 201 6). Corporate brand image applied to EB can be 
defined as the perception of an organization as reflected by th e brand association held in employee’s memory. 
Collins & Stevens (2002) applied this acknowledgement to the em ployer branding context and defined the 
employer attractiveness as the result of the “potential applica nts’ attitudes and perceived attributes about the job 
or organization” and employer branding as the process of buildi ng a unique and attractive image as an employer 
(Backhaus & Tikoo, 2004, p. 502).  
According to Moroko & Uncles (20 08), future employees create th eir perception of the employer attractiveness 
during the recruitment process, based on explicit information f rom the firm (job description), but also on 
informal information (recruitment experience), which makes the recruitment process vital for the creation of a 
strong employer image and the EB strategy. Ambler and Barrow (1 996) identified three factors driving employer 
image, namely functional, economi c and psychological. Kucherov & Zavyalova (2012) extend this list to 
comprise all the set of qualitative features of the employer im age that are attractive to a target audience. These 
features are described by a totally positive image and an appro priate set of both material (economic) and 
non-material (psychological and functional) advantages that dif ferentiate a company in the job market. Berthon 
et al. (2005) developed and validated a multi-item scale to ide ntify and operationalize the dimensions of 
employer image which in turn influences employer attractiveness . According to these authors, (1) interest value, 
(2) social value, (3) economic v alue, (4) development value and  (5) cooperation/application value are the five 
building blocks of the attractiveness of an employer’s brand: 1 . Interest value assesses attraction to an employer 
that offers an exciting work environment, with forward-thinking  and creativity, and an organization that 
encompasses innovation and intere st in product or services; 2. Social value which refers to the work environment 
and relations to other employees; 3.Economic value which relate s to economic benefits such as salary, 
compensation, promotion opportunities, and job security; 4. Dev elopment value assesses attraction to 
employment which supports career-enhancing experience, the poss ibility for future opportunities and provides 
recognition; 5. Cooperation value which encompasses the possibi lity to use what has been learned already, and it 
identifies an environment that is oriented primarily to satisfy  s o c i e t a l  n e e d s .  T a b l e  1  s h o w s  t h e  d i f f e r e n t  
dimensions, definitions and items as described by Berthon et al . (2005).

Note.  Employer branding dimensions as identified in Berthon et al. ( 2005). 
 
Of these factors, interest value and social value capture the p sychological benefits, while development value and 
cooperation value capture the fun ctional benefits. The differen t factors help build the employer image which then 
defines the extent to which a person is attracted to an employe r (Berthon et al., 2005). E B is thus affected by the 
employer’s notion of attractiveness and can be considered the r eflection of the image of an organisation. Figure 1. 
shows the employer branding framework which summarizes the key factors driving employer attractiveness, as 
resulting from the literature review.

2.3 The Use of Artificial Intelligence to Improve th e Employer Image and Employer Attractiveness 
Artificial intelligence (AI) “refer s to a field of computer sci ence dedicated to the creation of systems performing 
tasks that usually require human intelligence. It can be loosel y interpreted as incorporation of human intelligence 
into machines. In AI, machines com plete the task based on the s tipulated rules and algorithms. AI is an umbrella 
term for any computer program that has the touch of human intel ligence.” (Yao et al., 2019, p.15). AI is 
increasingly used to support deci sion-making processes in the w orkplace (Helbing et al., 2019), where 
algorithms throughout the use of  machine learning methods impro ve decision making processes without 
requiring the intervention of humans (Günther et al., 2017). Th e introduction of AI and its application in 
recruiting has increased the efficiency of the process, marking  a profound change within the HR field. AI is 
currently used to support three general sets of activities of r ecruitment, namely, outreach, screening, assessment. 
In the outreach stage, firms aim to identify candidates and pro mote job opportunities in ways that will push them 
to apply. AI supports this operation by tailoring the best pres entation methods (e.g., banner ads, email, text) for 
the different target candidates. In other words, the system lea rns and places job opportun ities via banners, popups, 
email, texts, etc. for the optim al uptake and response by targe ting the most suitable candidates’ profiles. The 
second stage requires doing an initial screening, which can be easily done by the AI based on fixed criteria 
defined by the recruiter (Campbell et al., 2020). Sharma has sh own how the use of AI at this stage can help 
achieve significant reductions for  companies in lead time from 60% to 90%. In addition, not only are firms 
competitive in the recruiting speed and efficiency that are pos sible with AI, but also, they potentially generate 
effective and high-quality services as well. For example, recen t research demonstrates that AI-enabled tools 
outperform at least 25% in screening applicants compared to hig h-quality, time-consuming evaluations of 
humans (Kuncel et al., 2014). 
The third stage refers to the use of AI not only in the pre-sel ection but also for assessment of the candidates. For 
example, Unilever uses AI-enabled interviews and evaluations to  narrow the original pool of over 45,000 
candidates for internships in the United States to 300 finalist s (Feloni, 2017). During the interview, the AI system 
asked candidates various questions and candidates submitted the ir recorded responses. The questions were based 
on an analysis of successful and average employees in those int ernship positions in the past. The system 
analyzed not only the content of  candidates’ responses but thei r word choice, tone of voice, and micro facial 
movements and correlated them to those of the company's success ful employees. Candidates were able to 
participate in the virtual interview on any day or at any time convenient to them within a several-day window. 
This not only saved countless hours in scheduling but also gave  candidates more control over the experience. 
What makes this third stage par ticularly relevant for the emplo yer branding process is tha t at this stage, potential 
candidates get in contact with the AI tool knowing they are goi ng to be evaluated by it. Ehrhart & Zieger (2005) 
have shown how the use of technology in general during the recr uitment process has a positive impact on the 
perceived attractiveness of the employer (Ehrhart & Zieger, 200 5). For instance, extant research reported that 
organisations prompted to the use of social media were perceive d as more attractive by j ob applicants (Pramod & 
Bharathi, 2016), as well as those  who actively used social medi a during the recruiting process (Van Esch et al., 
2020). Furthermore, ext ant research has shown that the use of A I in products and services  is correlated with more 
positive attitudes since people feel high control and accuracy towards the AI products and services (Hamilton & 
Davison, 2018). Finally, while extant research has recently cri ticized the supposed objectivity of AI (Campolo & 
Crawford, 2020; Crawford, 2016), showing how AI can also lead t o biases, research suggests that AI-enabled 

ijbm.ccsenet.org International Jo urnal of Business and Manageme nt V ol. 17, No. 2; 2022 
50 
 systems are perceived as less bi ased and more objective than hu mans by users (Van Esch et al., 2019). 
We can assume that all these factors can play a role in the acc eptance of AI-based technology when used for 
recruiting, and in particular, we can hypothesize that AI-based  technology for recruiting can project a positive 
image of the future employer, as it might be perceived as more objective, accurate, and unbiased, and therefore 
improve its attractiveness. Therefore, it can be hypothesized t hat the use of AI might be positively impacting the 
employer attractiveness and the employer image. We therefore de velop the follow hypothesis: 
H1: The use of AI in the recruitment process has a significant positive impact on the employer attractiveness and 
on the employer image. 
Figure 2 shows the final framework that includes the effect on the use of AI-enabled recruitment, both direct on 
employer attractiveness and indi rect through the impact on the employer image.

3. Method 
To assess whether the AI-enabled recruitment process is a relev ant factor significantly influencing the employer 
image and consequently the employer attractiveness, a quantitat ive analysis has been conducted. In the following 
paragraphs, we present the data , variables and model used to in vestigate how people perceive the use of AI in the 
recruitment process and to test our hypothesis. 
3.1 Data Collection This study employs a quantitative research approach by means of  a survey to answer the above research 
questions. The survey was distributed to a sample of the Italia n population during October 2019. Respondents 
were screened so that only those who were in the age range to b e potential job candidates were recruited, so that 
the eligible target is composed of people between 18 and 44 yea rs old. The total number of respondents is 312, 
however only 302 fit the validity of the study. The target repr esents country population distribution of gender for 
the segment under consideration (18-44) which is 49.7% men and 50.3% women. The survey was conducted 
using computer-assisted web interviewing (CAWI) methodology and  the questionnaire was presented online 
through a web-interface. 
3.2 Measures and Covariates 
In developing the questionnaire’s structure and contents, the e xisting literature has been taken into consideration 
in order to have a starting point of reference for the selected  study. The questionnaire (attached in appendix) 
comprises 12 questions: closed-ended questions and Likert 7-poi nts-scale response questions. The Likert scale 
was highly frequently used as a method of likelihood measuremen t as it allows respondents to choose one option 
that best aligns with their view and express the extent to whic h they agree or disagree with a particular question 
or statement. For instance, a t ypical scale might be “Strongly disagree, Disagree, Neutral, Agree, Strongly 
agree.”

 3.2.1 Covariates 
The following variables wer e used in the analysis: 
Employer attractiveness 
The overall employer attractiven ess is defined as the willingne ss to work for a company of the potential 
candidates, following Luce et al.  (2001). Particip ants were pro mpted the following question: “How willing 
would you be to undertake a selection process using artificial intelligence”. A 7-point Liker t scale ranging from 1 
(Completely unwilling) to 7 (Compl etely willing) was used to me asure the degree of willingness. 
AI-enabled recruitment factor 
In order to assess the impact that AI-enabled recruitment has o n the employer attractiveness and employer image, 
we developed an ad-hoc battery. The list of items resulted from  the literature review and comprises the following 
items:  
• Accuracy is defined as the perceived ability of AI to select th e best curricula in relation to the vacant 
position (Sharma, 2018). 
• Velocity is defined as the perceived ability of AI to provide c andidates with a final decision in a short 
period of time (Sharma, 2018). 
• Objectivity is defined as the perceived ability of AI to evalua te candidates only on skills and not on 
non-verbal communication (Bilic, 2 016; Black, Van Esch, 2020). 
• Reliability is defined as the pe rceived ability of AI to guaran tee no errors or misinterpretation during the 
process (Bilic, 2016). 
• Unbiasedness is defined as the perceived ability of AI to guara ntee a fair interview and evaluation only on 
the performances of the candidates (Black & Van Esch, 2020). 
We first run a correlation analysis with these five items and a  factor analysis to test whether all the items were 
related and associated to the latent component of the AI-enable d recruitment process. The  correlation coefficient 
showed that the Objectivity item had a general low correlation to the other variables compared to the rest of the 
variables. Then we ran a factor analysis (extraction method Max imum Likelihood, Oblimin rotation), to test 
whether all the items were contributing properly to the latent variable and found that the loading of the 
Objectivity item was below the accepted value of 0.500. We ther efore removed this item and ran the factor 
analysis with only four items. We found that all the items had high factor loadings on one factor, with Bartlett's 
test of sphericity significantly p-value significantly smaller than 0.05 and Kaiser-M eyer-Olkin Measure of 
Sampling Adequacy value around 0.902. The final list of items u sed in the final model comprises the following: 
Accuracy, Velocity, Reliability, and Unbiasedness. 
Employer image In order to capture the overall employer image, a multi-items s cale battery was used as developed by Berthon et 
al. (2005). The battery captures the five dimensions of the emp loyer image, namely (1) interest value, (2) social 
value, (3) economic value, (4) d evelopment value and (5) cooper ation/application value.  For each dimension, an 
exploratory factor analysis was carried out with the goal of se lecting only the most relevant items. The items 
were factor analyzed (extraction method Maximum Likelihood, Obl imin rotation), yielding a factorial structure 
in line with the original studies that developed the scales (i. e., with high factor loadings on one factor), with 
Bartlett's test of sphericity significantly p-value significant ly smaller than 0.05 and Ka iser-Meyer-Olkin Measure 
of Sampling Adequacy  value around .888. 
3.3 Analytical procedure 
In order to test the Employer branding framework as shown in fi gure 2, a structural equation model (SEM) 
analysis was carried out. SEM is  a combination of factor analys is and multiple regression and describes 
statistical relationships between  latent and manifest (measured ) variables. As Cooley (1978) states, this approach 
allows to establish the plausibility of a theoretical model and  to determine the degree to which the explanatory 
variables (causes) influence the dependent variable (latent). S EM is an alternative way of testing the consistency 
of a 'structural' theory through data; in this sense it is prim arily a 'confirmatory' rather than an 'exploratory' 
methodology. This method is preferred by the researcher because  it estimates the multiple and interrelated 
dependence in a single analysis. The variables represented with  ovals are latent variables, meaning that they are 
not directly observed (the variables that have been measured on  the subjects) but are inferred from the observed 
variables (rectangles) in order to explain their behaviour. Som e variables are independent (variables from which 
ijbm.ccsenet.org International Jo urnal of Business and Manageme nt V ol. 17, No. 2; 2022 
52 
 the arrows start) and they influence or determine other variabl es which are known as dependent (variables that 
receive the arrows). Additionally , SEM provides numerical estim ates for each of the parameters in the model to 
indicate the strength of the relationships. Thus, in addition t o testing the overall theory, SEM allows the 
researcher to diagnose which observed variables are good indica tors of the latent variables as well (MacCallum 
& Austin 2000). In the framework proposed, we analyzed second o rder SEM model, as the employer image is 
the latent dimension of four latent variables (ie. interest, de velopment, cooperation and AI-enabled recruitment 
f a c t o r s )  a n d  t w o  v a r i a b l e s  ( i e .  social and economic value). In order to apply SEM, we used the R package 
Lavaan that also visually represents the relationship between v ariables. 
4. Results 
In order to test whether the AI-enabled recruitment process has  an impact on the perceived employer 
attractiveness, we tested a SEM m odel as reported in Figure 3. 
 
 
Figure 3. Structural equation modeling results 
 
The overall model shows a good fit. In fact, looking at the com parative fit index (CFI), which compares the fit of 
a target model to the fit of an independent, or null, model, ou r model reached a CFI value of 0.933, above the 
0.900 which indicates a good model fit. Another index widely us ed to assess the quality of the model is the root 
mean square error of approximati on (RMSEA), which represents a parsimony-adjusted index. Values closer 
RMSEA <=0.08 represent a good fit. The study fits this value (0 .075). Note that all the p-values for the 
parameters estimate are shown a nd are all <0.000, which means h ighly significant. The AI-enabled recruitment 
factor is built out of the four dimensions discussed in the met hodology section, namely accuracy, velocity, 
reliability, and unbiasedness. All these dimensions are signifi cant. The dimension contributing most to the 
AI-enabled recruitment factor i s the accuracy (0.746***), meani ng that what respondents value most of the 
AI-enabled recruitment process is the fact that using AI they a re confident that they will be selected and 
positively evaluated if their curricula fit the position. The s econd dimension is the velocity (0.702***), meaning 
that the respondents appreciate th e fact that using AI in the r ecruitment process can speed up the whole process. 
The third dimension is the reliability (0.694***), meaning that  they perceived as more objective and reliable the 
selection made by the AI compared to the human recruiter. Final ly, the four dimension is unbiasedness 
(0.590***), meaning that they perceive the AI as assessing only  their performances and skills without being 
biased by human factors or non-verbal communication that might instead affect the decision of a human recruiter. 
The model shows also that the dimensions identified in Berthon e t  a l .  ( 2 0 0 5 ) ,  a r e  s i g n i f i c a n t l y  d e f i n i n g  t h e  
employer image. Among the different dimensions, the most releva nt is the development value (0.999***), which 
captures the perceived image of the employer as offering career  enhancing working opportunities. The second 
dimension is the interest value (0.954***), which captures the perceived image of the employer as offering work 
in a creative, innovative, and high-quality working environment . The third dimension is the cooperation value 
(0.951***), which captures the pe rceived image of the employer as providing a working environment that is

53 
 oriented towards society. The la st two dimensions are the socia l (0.805***) and economic (0.781***) values, 
which captures the perceived image of the employer as providing  a positive working environment to its 
employees, and good economic ben efits, respectively. The two fa ctors of AI-enabled recr uitment (0.416***) and 
employer image significantly and positively associate with the employer attractiveness (0 .265***). In particular, 
the AI-enabled recruitment factor impacts directly on the emplo yer attractiveness, meaning that the higher the 
recruitment process is driven by the AI, the higher the employe r attractiveness. Also, the AI-enabled recruitment 
factor impacts indirectly through its association with the empl oyer image (0.399***), for a total effect of 0.10. In 
fact, the usage of AI in recruitment positively associates with  an increase in employer image, which in turn 
impacts on the employer attractiv eness. Based on these findings , we can state that our hypothesis is confirmed: 
The use of AI in the recruitment process has a significant posi tive impact on the employ er attractiveness and on 
the employer image. 
5. Discussion 
The success of a firm increasingl y depends on its ability to at tract the best talents and successfully engage its 
employees, as this ability to engage present and future employe es is linked to a higher capability in providing 
value to its customers and it ha s been found critical to ensure  (Colleoni et al., 2021). 
This has implied an increased relevance of the recruitment proc ess as strategic tool for competitive advantage 
and led organisations to introduce increasingly sophisticated t echnologies for recruiting, such as AI tools in the 
recruitment process (Pramod & Bh a r a t h i ,  2 0 1 6 ) .  W h i l e  a  b i g  p o r t ion of the past research on recruiting and 
selection mainly assessed the reliability and validity of the r ecruitment and selection process, activities, and 
techniques (Newell, 2005, Van Esch et al., 2019), there is a la ck of research about the candidates’ view on 
AI-enabled recruitment systems and in particular, whether candi dates during the recruitment make positive 
associations with the organization. In order to shed light on w hether AI-enabled recruitment indeed is positively 
associated with employer attractiveness, a quantitative study h as been carried out using a survey and an 
employer branding framework has been developed and empirically validated using SEM modeling. 
Results show that AI-enabled r ecruitment significantly impacts on the perceived employer attractiveness, directly 
by making the employer be perceived as more accurate, fair, and  reliable in the recruitment process, and 
indirectly, by impacting on the employer image. 
All in all, this study presents several implications for organi zations. The present research showed a direct and 
positive relationship between the extent to which candidates pe rceive the use of AI-enabled technologies during 
the selection process as a positive factor and the level of org anisation’s attractiveness.  This suggests that moving 
forward in time organisations may want to highlight, rather tha n hide, the fact that they use AI-enabled tools 
during the recruitment process. 
T h i s  s t u d y  s h o w s  h o w  c r i t i c a l  t h e  u s e  o f  n e w  t e c h n o l o g i e s  c a n  b e for organizations not only to improve 
effectiveness in its processes, but also to improve their perce ption as employers of choice. It is acknowledged 
that building effective employer branding is a time-consuming p rocess that requires consistency and coherence. 
However, nowadays, more than ever, attracting the best talents is key for a company's success and this process 
can be supported with the introduction of AI-enabled recruitmen t processes. Indeed, the findings of this research 
highlight the fact that AI provides promising solutions for org anizations that aim to win the war for talents by 
shaping the perception of candida tes appearing as employers of choice.
